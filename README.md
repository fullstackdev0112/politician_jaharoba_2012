infographic-politicians
=======================

This is an interactive graph of the Romanian members of parliament for the 2008-2012 mandate. It uses data pulled from [Harta Politicii](http://hartapoliticii.ro/), which has their attendance percentage, the percentage in which they voted against their party and if they're running for another term.

This was done as an excercise in using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and currently uses the [Circle Packing](http://bl.ocks.org/4063530) as the representation model for the politicians. The bigger a politician's circle is, the more he went to work. :)

The project was generated with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and has no server-side component. The data is stored statically as JSON files - this means it can be deployed anywhere.
